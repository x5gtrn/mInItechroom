**[Slack](https://slack.com/is)**
> *Team communication for the 21st century.*


- The place on the internet that had moved from physical place in Chiyoda, Japan
- Simply, It's an **internet chat room** on an invite-only basis

### I decided to create Slack Team

I'd like to create and have an internet space just like my room was before in Tokyo.

I'm a heavy user of Slack. Itâ€™s really necessary for me, for my work. Slack has been great tool to collaborate and communicate with team member. So, I created new Slack Team and named it **mInItechroom** on February 2017.


### My ideas and concepts for this Slack Team

- Like a house that it has many rooms (many Slack Channels) and **gathering spots** where we can talk/hangout
    - My room in Chiyoda was tiny studio having physical limits

When I just created the Slack Team, people who has invited from me were my friends who had the experience of staying in my room, and know at least one other person of the first member except me.

Please imagine it's nothing strange situation when you come to my room and meet other my friend first time and having new friendship. Also, I'd like you to invite your friends to join this Slack Team just as I would welcome you and your friend to my room.

Please simply treat the chatroom as like as my room. You can come anytime, you can leave (just leave for a while, or completely leave) anytime as well. I know there are many people not familiar to you when you joined first time. You can say something, you can keep silent and only read.

I hope here to be virtual Small Haven. Even now, I love Small Haven which had located in Chiyoda so much. Many people had came there and stayed and talked with me, sometimes with my friend as well. Then became friend each other.
